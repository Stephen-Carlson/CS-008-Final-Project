    <h1>Our Home</h1>

    <p>
        You have managed to find yourself on the website of The Schtick. We are glad
        that you have put in the effort to look us up and now we are willing to tell 
        you anything that you need to know about our group. On our page you will be 
        able to learn about our updated tour dates, news about our members, photos 
        from our recent tours, and new tunes. Along with the information we give you, 
        we would love if you would fill in our form so that we can give you updates  
        on where we are performing. You do not need to worry about us sending you 
        worthless emails that will only fill up your inbox. We will only send you 
        what you want to be sent. The Schtick has recently been working with countries 
        in South Africa to donate a portion of the revenue from our Love tour to help impoverished
        families. If you are interested in making additional donations to the cause,
        feel free to contact us and we will provide you with more information. 
    </p>

        If you have photos from any of our concerts that you want to post online,
        us our hashtag: #schtickedup. If you post a photo with this hashtag we may just
        post it on our page or story with a shout out to your page. We believe that
        the more people who know about us and our movement, the more we can begin to 
        raise awareness for the families that need our help, the more we can do.
        The band has been constantly planning new tour dates in locations we have
        never been before. With our new album coming out, we are trying to recreate
        our image. Instead of focusing on the fame and glory that comes with this life,
        our new focus is the people that listen to us. We make music for the people on
        this Earth and the goal is that even the people who do not listen to our music
        feel the effects our work through the work that the Love Tour is doing. Promoting
        the ideas behind working together and sharing wealth with the part of the population
        that needs it the most, this is the philosophy that us in the band share.
        If you have the time, read some of the work on the about page! If you are
        interested in one of the specific band members, we also have short biographies
        for each of them.
